PI is short for `Package Installer`.

## Supported Versions
Android 10 ~ 14

## What's this?
This app is used to install packages (and it has other features I want). For me, it is an exploratory project that helps me to learn more about [AOSP](https://cs.android.com/). Therefore, it is open-sourced under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
> **NOTE**: This implies that this project will not focus much on user experience. Thank you for your understanding.
